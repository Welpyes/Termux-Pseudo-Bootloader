# Termux-Pseudo-Bootloader
A rewrite of my 'pseudo systemd bootloader bash script' to the C programming language 

dependencies:
```
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install ncurses libyaml clang make
```

compile:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Welpyes/Termux-Pseudo-Bootloader
cd $HOME/Termux-Pseudo-Bootloader
make
```

this is just a byproduct of me learning c and stuff.
